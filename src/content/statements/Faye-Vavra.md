FAYE VAVRA'S ART UTILIZES A VISUAL STYLE OF LAYERED WRITING AS A MOTIF AND PERSONAL PRACTICE THROUGHOUT MOST OF HER WORK. THIS WRITING REPRESENTS FEELINGS OF FEAR, OVERTHINKING, AND WORRY THAT CAN COME WITH EXPERIENCES OF ANXIETY, ADHD, AND OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH. EXPELLING THESE WORDS VIA STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS JOURNALING AND REGISTERING THEM ILLEGIBLE DIMINISHES THEIR POWER, AND INSTEAD LEAVES A UNIFORM CANVAS WITH WHICH VAVRA CAN WORK UPON.

<i>IN COLLABORATION WITH STICKS AND STONES</i> EXPLORES THE EXPERIENCE OF SELF AWARENESS. ONE CAN BECOME ATTUNED TO CERTAIN BEHAVIORS OR HAVITS WITHIN THEMSELVES THAT THEY WISH TO CHANGE, BUT MIGHT NOT YET HAVE THE WILLPOWER OR MEANS TO CHANGE THEM. THIS CAN RESULT IN PARALLELED FEELINGS OF SELF CRITICISM AND RESENTMENT, OR A SENSE OF PERFORMATIVITY. HOWEVER WITHIN AN AIR OF ANXIETY, VAVRA ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE PEOPLE AND THINGS IN HER LIFE THAT HAVE BROUGHT JOY AND COMFORT TO HER EXISTENCE AND SELF VIEW. IN COLLABORATION WITH NATURE, IDENTITY, CHILDHOOD, AND HER BEST FRIEND KELLY LIN, THIS INSTALLATION SUMMARIZES THE SILVER LININGS AND GRATITUDE SHINING THROUGH MOMENTS OF DOUBT AND WORRY.
