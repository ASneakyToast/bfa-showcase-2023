El Terreno Prometido came about as an inside joke from Bryan Dominguez's family. On his father's side of the family the uncles competed in having a first born male son due to their father saying he would pass on the land to that grandchild. Dominguez was that first born male grandchild, automatically there is a sense of belonging. Dominquez understands this type of acceptance and belonging comes from a masculine ideology, however, he uses this opportunity to reflect on how he uses the space not just for himself but inviting others to reminisce about a time and place of comfort.
