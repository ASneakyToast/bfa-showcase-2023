My obsession with marine life started from collecting seashells and coral from the ocean. I have glass jars all around the house filled with seashells, holding memories of different beaches, oceans, and ecosystems. Then I was introduced to scuba diving, being able to breathe underwater for an hour exploring an alien-like environment that was so different from the land above. The ocean was so quiet only the sound of your breathing and your thoughts. The ocean is my safe place, for me to think about my life and make up scenarios in my head.

I vividly remember going to Kenting, Taiwan for multiple years. As the years passed coral started to turn white and die, and the biodiversity was depleting. The ocean is a sacred place and a big part of me, of us, and we are slowly killing it. It saddens me that humans have contributed to climate change, killing these ecosystems for our satisfaction rather than conserving it.

My work uses recycled plastic bottles and recycled metals. I wanted to use plastic as the setting for my creatures. Showing how much plastic waste is in the ocean. My creatures are inspired by real life entities in the sea. Showing they're alien like characteristics, and the beauty it holds. Contrasting with the plastic waste. Using heat to manipulate the plastic, and wearing a respirator shows how toxic and hard to break down plastic is. My creatures are designed in nomad, a 3D modeling app, then are casted in fine silver and bronze, with hints of color using enamel.

My goal is for people to understand their plastic consumption has consequences, not only in the ocean but the whole world. The ocean is Earth lungs, 80% of oxygen comes from the ocean. If everyone can contribute to preserving the ocean, it would only benefit our future.
