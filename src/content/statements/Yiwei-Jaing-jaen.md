Because of my travels and study abroad experiences, I've fallen in love with nature. The mountains, sea, leaves, flowers, everything from nature takes me away from crowded city life, and gives me a sense of comfort. In recent years, I realized that the world has changed, the earth has been damaged. In Iceland, the icebergs are getting smaller, the glaciers are gone. In many countries, the air is smoggy, and greenery is replaced with factories and human residential buildings. The touristy images online no longer exist in the real world, trash is everywhere, air and water are polluted, and global temperatures are rising. At this point, I feel like my paradise is in ruin.

In recent years, humans started to make changes. But the world has already been damaged. Inspired by the ocean and the natural habitat, I make my art to represent pollution and how animals have been affected. I make body adornments that draw on elements of pollution, making it visible in different materials on the human body. I use the techniques of hollowware, casting, and fabrication. Other than metals, I also used plastic trash and plaster. I make uncomfortable structures that represent disease and the consequences of pollution on the human body

In fashion, we wear clothes and shoes that are beautiful but uncomfortable or even painful such as high heels, corsets, and light clothes. In my work, I make beautiful adornments inspired by pollution that also hurts the wearer. Humans can create beautiful things, but what are the consequences and side effects?

Nature has its limits. There is a limit to what we can get from nature, but it is clear we consume far more than we need. We want to continue to live, but the planet we live on is dying. We need to heal the world, but the first thing is for everyone to understand the problem and realize it's destroying us. I hope my exhibition will help people to realize the seriousness of the problem, and to ignite change.

Human beings only change their way of treating the Earth when their benefits get harmed. We are getting things more than we need from the planet to make our life better, but the problem is, the planet has its limit, we are getting for more than the planet can handle.

As what animals got attacked by the pollution human beings made, we are also getting attacked. I'm making body adornments to represent the pollution on the human body making them really uncomfortable to show the relationship between us and nature.

Just like the relationship between the human body and pretty other/shoes/decorations, many people wear very uncomfortable things to look really good, but actually, these things are hurting your badly badly, like high heels, very light clothes, etc. So in my art works, I'm trying to connect beauty in fashion with pollution. We are making our life better and beautiful but at the same time, pollution is happening. Just like what I made, these body adornments look pretty on the human body, but they are also really painful when you wear them.
