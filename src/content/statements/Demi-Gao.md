Demi Gao primarily uses the mediums of oils and acrylics, which allow her to express depth and texture in her paintings. Her work often incorporates symbolism and explores areas of the inner life and the collective unconscious.
Demi's artwork draws inspiration from an assortment of sources. Her passion for literature, particularly philosophy, psychology, and detective fiction, has enabled her to incorporate intricate perspectives and narratives into her paintings.
Demi has also been impacted by her family, who are specialized antique collectors with a passion for collecting antiquities. As a result, she developed an early fascination with traditional ancient Chinese art, which is evident in a number of her artworks. Although her mother adheres to the Buddhist faith, she considers Buddhism to be more of a philosophical concept. Jung, for instance, formulated a theory concerning the collective unconscious that bears resemblance to the Buddhist doctrine of Anatta, which translates to "no-self." Buddhism explores the fundamental aspects of existence, life, and reality. She integrates elements of mystique and introspection into her work. She hopes that her work invites the viewer to contemplate deeper questions about spirituality, existance, and the universe. Additionally, she merges elements of Eastern and Western philosophy in her worldview and artistic expression. Her broader goal is to express reflection on the world through her experiences.
